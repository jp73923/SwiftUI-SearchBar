What is a search bar in iOS?

A search bar is a user interface element that allows users to search for specific content within an app. In iOS apps, the search bar is often positioned at the top of the screen, making it easy for users to locate and use. Users can type keywords or phrases into the search bar, and the app will display results that match the search criteria. Search bars are particularly useful in apps that have a large amount of content, such as music, video, or news apps, where users may want to find specific content quickly and easily. The SwiftUI framework includes a searchable view modifier that developers can use to implement this functionality in their apps.

iOS can add a search bar to our views using the searchable() modifier, and we can bind a string property to it to filter our data as the user types.

Prior to iOS 15, SwiftUI didnâ€™t come with a built-in modifier for handling search in List views. Developers have to create your own solution. We have written a tutorial showing you how to implement a search bar in SwiftUI using TextField and display the search result. With the release of iOS 15, the SwiftUI framework brings a new modifier named searchable to List views.
